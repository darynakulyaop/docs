# What is porting?

Phone number porting is the process of transferring your existing phone number from your current carrier to OpenPhone. This allows you to keep your familiar business number while upgrading to our modern phone system.

## What is Number Porting?

Number porting is the process of transferring your existing phone number from your current carrier to OpenPhone. This means you can keep your familiar business number while upgrading to OpenPhone's advanced features.

When you port your number, you're essentially moving your phone number from one service provider to another. The number itself stays the same, but the underlying service and features change to OpenPhone's system.
