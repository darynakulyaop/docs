# Guide to US carrier registration for OpenPhone customers

The major US carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon) are taking collective action to protect their customers from today's overwhelming volume of fraudulent calls and texts. Any business sending messages to US numbers through a cloud-based phone provider such as OpenPhone must register to be approved as a US carrier. This applies to businesses with and without a valid EIN or similar business ID.

<Callout type="info">
Only paying OpenPhone customers have access to US carrier registration settings. You'll also need to be an owner or admin of your workspace using OpenPhone’s web or desktop app to view and submit the US carrier registration form. Customers who are currently on a trial need to convert to a paid account to complete this registration. [Learn how to switch to a paid account here](#).
