# Guide to US carrier registration for OpenPhone customers

The major US carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon) are taking collective action to protect their customers from today's overwhelming volume of fraudulent calls and texts. Any business sending messages to US numbers through a cloud-based phone provider such as OpenPhone must register to be approved as a US carrier. This applies to businesses with and without a valid EIN or similar business ID.

> **Note**  
> Only paying OpenPhone customers have access to US carrier registration settings. You'll also need to be an owner or admin of your workspace using OpenPhone’s web or desktop app to view and submit the US carrier registration form. Customers who are currently on a trial need to convert to a paid account to complete this registration. [Learn how to switch to a paid account here](#).

## Important to note

- Your text messages will only be successfully delivered if you have a successful registration.
- Carrier registration from a previous carrier does not continue when an existing number is ported into OpenPhone.
- If you end your OpenPhone subscription and don't restore it within 30 days, your registration of that number also ends.

## Registration for businesses or users without an EIN

If you don’t have an EIN (or other business ID outside the US) and still want to text US numbers, you can register as a sole proprietor. You’ll need:

- A US or Canadian address  
- A working mobile number with a +1 country code

> **Note**  
> If you register through the sole proprietor path, only one of your OpenPhone numbers can text US numbers.

### Want to text from multiple numbers?

- If you're in the US, get an EIN. It may take 2–30 days for your info to appear in carrier databases.
- Outside the US? Get a business ID relevant to your location.

### After registering

- You can send up to 3,000 message segments/day, including 1,000 to T-Mobile (subject to Fair use policy)
