# A2P 10DLC Registration

The major US carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon) are taking collective action to protect their customers from today's overwhelming volume of fraudulent calls and texts. Any business sending messages to US numbers through a cloud-based phone provider such as OpenPhone must register to be approved as a US carrier. This applies to businesses with and without a valid EIN or similar business ID.

Only paying OpenPhone customers have access to US carrier registration settings. You'll also need to be an owner or admin of your workspace using OpenPhone's web or desktop app to view and submit the US carrier registration form. Customers who are currently on a trial need to convert to a paid account to complete this registration. Learn how to switch to a paid account here.

## Important to note

- Your text messages will only be successfully delivered if you have a successful registration.
- Carrier registration from a previous carrier does not continue when an existing number is ported into OpenPhone.
- If you end your OpenPhone subscription and don't restore it within 30 days, your registration of that number also ends.

## Who does this impact?

US carrier registration applies to any business sending messages to US numbers through a cloud phone provider (like OpenPhone and others).

## Benefits of US carrier registration for virtual phone users

By completing the US carrier registration process, you can improve your text deliverability rates and lower the risk of carriers filtering your outbound text messages on their network. As of August 31, 2023, if you're not registered, you will not be able to text US phone numbers using OpenPhone.

## Registering for businesses with an EIN or equivalent tax ID number

To complete registration on behalf of a company, you'll need an EIN or another valid business identification number to register.

You are not able to register as a business using a Social Security Number; see the Sole Proprietor and Personal Use sections of this guide to determine your eligibility to register based on each path.

By completing this registration, your workspace will have Low Volume Standard status giving you the option:

- to send up to 6,000 message segments per day, including up to 2,000 segments to T-Mobile numbers (subject to our Fair use policy)
- to text from any phone numbers in your OpenPhone workspace; any additional numbers added to your account after your registration is approved will also be automatically associated with your approved registration

100% of the fees mentioned below go to The Campaign Registry and other third-party entities to help you register and stay in good standing with the US cell carriers.

### Fees

**Carrier review and setup fees:** The Campaign Registry, a third-party agency chosen by the major US cell carriers, collects a one-time fee of $19 to review your application in two phases. In the first review, The Campaign Registry completes an initial screen of your application. A third-party entity then does a second manual review of the information you supply in the registration form. *

**Messaging fee:** The Campaign Registry charges a $1.50 per month fee to help you maintain Low Volume Standard status with the large US cell carriers. For non-profit organizations, TCR charges instead a $3 per month fee.

*A $15 resubmission fee applies and goes to our carrier partner if your application is rejected. Be sure to check out our guide to completing the US carrier registration form as an organization.

## Registration for businesses and other users without an EIN or other tax ID number

For businesses or other users without an EIN (or another form of business ID if you're based outside the US) and wish to text any US number through OpenPhone, you'll need the following to register through our sole proprietor path:

- a US or Canadian address
- a working mobile number with a country code of +1

Keep in mind also if you have multiple phone numbers with OpenPhone, only one of your OpenPhone numbers will be able to text to US numbers if you register through the sole proprietor path.

Wanting to have multiple phone numbers that can text? If you're based in the US, you'll need to obtain an EIN. Keep in mind it can take from two weeks to thirty (30) days for your company's information to be available in the databases used by the organizations that review your carrier registration information.

If you reside outside of the US and wish to be able to text from multiple OpenPhone numbers, you'll need to obtain another form of business ID based on where you're based.

After successfully registering, you can send up to 3,000 message segments per day, including up to 1,000 segments to T-Mobile numbers (subject to our Fair use policy).
