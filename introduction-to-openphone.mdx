## What makes OpenPhone different?

If youʼve used a business phone before — whether a traditional desk phone or a virtual one — you might be wondering what sets OpenPhone apart.

### Collaborative

OpenPhone is designed to help your team work better together. Share numbers, take calls, send messages, troubleshoot customer issues as a group, and more.

### Customizable

Use OpenPhone your way with a business phone setup that works for you:

- Set your teamʼs business hours
- Configure a phone menu and ring groups
- Create auto-replies and branded voicemail greetings

### Convenient

Wherever you go, OpenPhone goes too. With our desktop, mobile, and browser apps, you can take calls anywhere, at any time.

## How does OpenPhone work?

OpenPhone is a **Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)** phone system.

Instead of using traditional phone lines that transmit voice signals over copper wires, VoIP systems:

- Break voice data into digital signals ("packets")
- Send them over the Internet
- Convert them back into analog signals so recipients can hear you

With VoIP, you can:

  — all without niche telecom hardware or bulky desk phones.
