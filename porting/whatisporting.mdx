Porting is the process of transferring a phone number from one provider to a different provider. This is most often done in the process of switching providers.

Porting your existing number to OpenPhone is a four-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit port request">
    We submit a port request to your current provider and negotiate a port date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Port date confirmed">
    Once we hear back, we inform you of the port date & time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="We port your number over">
    On the port date, we make your phone number available in your OpenPhone account.
  </Step>
  <Step title=" Cancel service with previous provider">
    Once the number is ported successfully, you can cancel your account with your current provider.
  </Step>
</Steps>
