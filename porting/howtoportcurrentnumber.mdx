## How to port your number to OpenPhone

Follow these steps to initiate the porting process:

1. Go to [`Settings`](https://my.openphone.com/settings/), then **Phone numbers**, then select **Port an existing number**.
2. Click **Continue to porting**.
3. Enter your local US, Canadian, or North American toll-free number.  
   - Select your current carrier from the dropdown.  
   - If your carrier isn’t listed, manually type in the name.
4. Upload a recent **billing statement** for verification.
5. Provide your **carrier credentials**:
   - **Account number**
   - **Transfer/port PIN**  
   Most local US numbers require a PIN, which can usually be found in your current provider’s account dashboard. If unsure, contact your current carrier.
6. Assign an icon and name for your number.
7. Digitally sign to authorize OpenPhone to port the number.
8. Click **Submit** — you're done!

<note>
Once submitted, the porting request can't be changed from the OpenPhone app.

## How long does the porting process take?

The process typically takes **1 to 2 weeks**, depending on how quickly your current carrier responds.

<tip>
There’s no service interruption — you can continue using your number until the port date.
</tip>

After the port:
- Calling and texting should begin working right away.
- SMS may take **up to 48 hours** to fully stabilize due to carrier routing delays.
